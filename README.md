# **Credit Score Prediction**  

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on **cleaning, transforming, and analyzing financial data** to predict a customer's **credit score category** (Low, Medium, High). The model helps in **credit risk assessment** for financial institutions.  

## **Key Features**  
✅ Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features  
✅ Feature Engineering: Normalization, correlation analysis, and selection  
✅ Model Training: Using **RandomForestClassifier** for prediction  
✅ Model Evaluation: Accuracy score & classification report  
✅ Deployment: Saved trained model and preprocessing objects  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python, Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (ML Model, Preprocessing)  
- **Google Colab** (Execution Platform)  

## **Usage**  
1. **Upload the dataset** to Google Colab.  
2. **Run the script** for data preprocessing & model training.  
3. **View predictions** & model evaluation metrics.  
4. **Save the trained model** for future use.  

## **Results**  
✔ Achieved **~80-85% accuracy** in predicting credit scores.  
✔ Model helps classify customers based on **credit risk levels**.  

🚀 **Future Enhancements:**  
- Improve accuracy with **XGBoost or Neural Networks**.  
- Deploy model as an **API for real-time predictions**.
