Credit Score Prediction  

Overview
This project focuses on **cleaning, transforming, and analyzing financial data** to predict a customer's **credit score category** (Low, Medium, High). The model helps in **credit risk assessment** for financial institutions.  

Key Features  
 Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features  
 Feature Engineering: Normalization, correlation analysis, and selection  
 Model Training: Using **RandomForestClassifier** for prediction  
 Model Evaluation: Accuracy score & classification report  
 Deployment: Saved trained model and preprocessing objects  

Technologies Used  
 **Python, Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
 **Scikit-Learn** (ML Model, Preprocessing)  
 **Google Colab** (Execution Platform)  

 Usage  
  Upload the dataset to Google Colab.  
   Run the script for data preprocessing & model training.  
  View predictions & model evaluation metrics.  
  Save the trained model for future use.  

Results 
 Achieved **~80-85% accuracy** in predicting credit scores.  
 Model helps classify customers based on **credit risk levels**.  

Future Enhancements:  
- Improve accuracy with **XGBoost or Neural Networks**.  
- Deploy model as an **API for real-time predictions**.
